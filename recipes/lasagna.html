    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>It was a crisp fall morning, and.... Just kidding. Here's a recipe for my favorite lasagna.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients list:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 large white onion</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>1 14 oz. can of tomato puree</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>16 large Lasagna noodles (Homemade preferred)</li>
        <li>6 oz. Parmesan cheese (Freshly grated preferred)</li>
        <li>4 cups mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp each of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Parsley</li>
                <li>Basil</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
                <li>Fennel seeds</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely dice both the onion and garlic</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef and half of all the desired seasonings, mix until thoroughly incorporated</li>
        <li>In a large skillet on medium-high heat, add 1 tbsp of olive oil. Once preheated, add half of the diced onions. </li>
        <li>Cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the onions turn translucent and become soft, then add half of the diced garlic and cook an additional 1-2 minutes</li>
        <li>Once the onions and garlic are fragrant and slightly browned, add the beef mixture in a large skillet until thoroughly cooked and brown bits (fond) start sticking to the bottom of the pan. </li>
        <li>Add your 2 tbsp of tomato paste and cook for 30-60 seconds</li>
        <li>Just before the tomato paste begins to burn, add in the entire can of your tomato puree and scrape up all of the fond off the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 20-30 minutes</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, start a large pot of boiling water on the largest burner you have.</li>
        <li>Once the water is at a rolling boil, add 2 tbsp of salt (optional) just before adding your lasagna noodles and give them a quick stir.</li>
        <li>Cook at a rolling boil for 6-8 minutes, or until al dente (the noodles should be soft on the outside, but slightly undercooked on the inside. The noodles will finish cooking in the oven)</li>
        <li>Strain the noodles, and right about this time the sauce should be done cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit</li>
        <li>In a 9 in. by 12 in. oven-safe dish, add a ladle full of sauce to prevent the noodles from sticking.</li>
        <li>
            Alternate layers of sauce, noodles, and ricotta cheese up until there's approximately 1/2 an inch left at the top of the dish.
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight: 700; font-size: larger; font-style: italic;">Make sure to get the fillings all the way to the edge for even cooking!!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you don't have pre-grated mozarella cheese, grate it now, and then spread the grated cheese evenly across the top of the dish.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish tightly with aliminum foil, and bake for 35-45 minutes. 10 minutes before it's done cooking, remove the foil to get some nice golden-brown spots on top of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and let rest at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
