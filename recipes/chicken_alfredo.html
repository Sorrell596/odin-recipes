    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>It was a cool winter evening. My father had just came back from hiking to work (6 miles, in the snow, uphill, both ways, while fighting a bear), and.... Alright, I kid, I kid. Here's the recipe for the worlds best Chicken Alfredo.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients list:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. Chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>1 box Fettuchini noodles</li>
        <li>2 sticks of butter</li>
        <li>1 qt. Heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>12 oz. Parmesan cheese (Freshly grated)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground white pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cream cheese</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Fresh Parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Fettuchini Noodles</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with a large pot of water with a few pinches of salt. Bring it to a rolling boil</li>
                <li>Once the water is at a rolling boil, add enough noodles to support the number of guests to feed, and boil according to package directions</li>
                <li>Once the noodles are cooked, strain and place back in the pot. Add a conservative amount of olive oil to prevent the noodles from sticking</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Chicken Breasts</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Coat the bottom of a large pan with olive oil, and begin heating the pan on medium-high heat</li>
                <li>Butterfly the chicken breasts, and pound it flat with a meat mallet (or the largest flat-bottomed glass drinking cup you have) to ensure even cooking</li>
                <li>Pat the chicken completely dry with a paper towel, before lightly seasoning both sides of the chicken breasts with salt & pepper</li>
                <li>Once the oil is shimmering in the pan, place 1-3 chicken breasts in the pan, making sure that the pan isn't too crowded</li>
                <li>Cook until the bottom is golden brown, then flip and cook the other side until the internal temperature is 165 degrees fahrenheit</li>
                <li>Repeat until all of the chicken breasts are cooked</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Alfredo Sauce</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with a medium pot on medium-low heat</li>
                <li>Place your two sticks of butter into the pot to begin melting</li>
                <li>While the butter is melting, mince both cloves of garlic. For additional garlic flavor, you can add a 1-2 tsp of salt and scrape the blade of your knife (while laying the knife as flat as possible on the cutting board) across the garlic to turn it into a garlic paste</li>
                <li>With the butter fully melted, turn the heat up to medium for the pot, and add your garlic</li>
                <li>Let the garlic fry in the oil for a minute or two, then add the cream cheese. Softened cream cheese will be easier, and you'll want to break up the cream cheese with a whisk</li>
                <li>After the cream cheese is incorporated into the butter, add the heavy whipping cream.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce begins to bubble or boil, reduce the temperature to a simmer, and stir often to prevent the bottom from burning.</li>
                <li>While waiting for the sauce to thicken, grate your fresh parmesan cheese as fine as possible.</li>
                <li>Continue simmering until thickened. You should be able to coat the back of a spoon, and pull your finger through it, leaving without the liquid filling the void left by your finger</li>
                <li>Once the mixture is thickened as mentioned above, begin slowly adding all but a cup of your grated parmesan cheese, a quarter of a cup at a time, thoroughly but gently whisking the sauce until the cheese is fully melted and emulsified into the sauce.</li>
                <li>After adding all of the cheese (with the exception of the cheese we set aside for garnishing), add salt and white pepper to taste</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Plating</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin with a sizeable portion of your noodles on a warm plate</li>
                <li>Slice the chicken breast and place atop the noodles</li>
                <li>Add a conservative spoonful of sauce on top of the chicken (A little bit of sauce goes a long way!)</li>
                <li>Garnish with pepper, parsley, and parmesan</li>
                <li>(Optional) Serve with some garlic bread</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
